# Stable Baselines RL Colab Notebooks

Colab notebooks part of the documentation of [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) reinforcement learning library


Those notebooks are independent examples.

We recommend looking at [rl-tutorial-jnrr19](https://github.com/araffin/rl-tutorial-jnrr19) for a more complete tutorial.

Note: we highly recommend to read the [documentation](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/) too.
